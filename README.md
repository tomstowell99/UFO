# UFO

## Purpose of this website
   This website is created to help fellow UFO enthusiasts quickly search the public database of UFO sights. We can easily filter by five different  
   criteria to refine our search, (date, city, state country and shape)
   
## How to use the website
   We have five filtered options to select from to narrow down our search for UFO sightings.
   below we can see what the website returns with no filters selected, the default setting.
   We can filter on one or more of the filters or we can choose to select not updates and keep the default view.

   To filter the website:
   * Date Filter - select a date to review. do not use leading zeros for the day and month. The format is Month/Day/Year.
   * City - type in the full city.
   * State - use the state abbreviation code. For Arkansas as an example would be ar.
   * County - Enter the country abbreviation code. For the United States, for example, it would be us.
   * Shape - Enter the shape of the UFO. for example (circle, light, triangle, etc.)

   After each filter change press enter and the data will update. Below is an example of choosing all five filters. this narrowed our results to just one record.

## Summary
   The website pulls the information we are looking for but to filter the results the user must know exactly how the data is entered into the db. So for example if I was 
   searching for a triangle shaped object and typed in trianguler. I would not pull back any results.
   
   * The major drawback is the requirement that our search criteria be entered in exactly as it is in the database.
   
   ### improvement suggestions
      * Adding an interactive map with radius selection. This would make selecting a location much easier and allow the user to select areas without knowing 
        the names of the cities.
        
      * An aggregation function should be added. We currently have to count each record to know how many UFO's were sited.
